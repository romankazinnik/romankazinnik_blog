1.0 NLP comparative analysis of words embedding vs. bag of words, w/o characters embedding trained with CNN, w/o capital cases embedding

2.0 python nametagging_cnn_rnn.py

2.1 two training examples: small input (<500 words) vs. large input (> 15K words)

2.2 Conclusion 1: notice when [low dimensional] word embedding does not help

2.5 Conclusion 2: notice when training for letters embedding does not help
