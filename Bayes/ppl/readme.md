Supervised ML can be a powerful tool, however there is a range of problems where its utilization can't be justified. Such problems include reasoning, distributions learning. U til recently solving large-scale problems was limited to Supervised ML. Introduction of deep-learning PyTorch based pyro.ai opens opportunities to apply Unsupervised Learning to large-scale problems.
